<p>Learn another programming language.</p>

<p>Learn from another programming ecosystem.</p>

<p>Learn from another programming language’s tools and bring it back to the language you love.</p>

<p>Fact is, I love Ruby!</p>

<p>However, I’ve been spending a lot of time with Node.js lately. NPM provides a nice way to install
any new packages straight from the command line, like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm install react --save
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I like this convenience.</p>

<p>With an intention to improve Ruby’s ecosystem and tools, I would like to bring this to Ruby.</p>

<p>So, I’ve added a <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4932">new issue</a> to Bundler. Let’s see what others feel about it.</p>

<p><strong>Update - 31 August 2016</strong></p>

<p>I had a couple of responses for my Bundler issue and it turns out there is indeed a way to add gems via bundler’s CLI.</p>

<p>You can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">inject</code> command like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle inject pg 0.18.4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You have to specify the exact version that you want to add though.</p>

<p>Next version of Bundler is going one better and will expose <code class="highlighter-rouge">add</code> command that will add the gem without needing a version number.</p>

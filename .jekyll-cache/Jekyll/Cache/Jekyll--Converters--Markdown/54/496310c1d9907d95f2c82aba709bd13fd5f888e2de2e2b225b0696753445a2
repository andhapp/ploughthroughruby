title: Yarn install on Mojave
date_string: 27 September 2019
â€”</p>

<p>If youâ€™re having issues in <code class="highlighter-rouge">yarn install</code> on Mojave, then itâ€™s probably down to the fact
that Mojave doesnâ€™t support different i386 architecture and anything that involves native
building, gems or node modules, seems to fail. The solution is to clean the slate and start
fresh. Thatâ€™s exactly what I had to do to fix the yarn installation errors:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rm yarn.lock
yarn cache clean
yarn install
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These commands worked like a charm!</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>

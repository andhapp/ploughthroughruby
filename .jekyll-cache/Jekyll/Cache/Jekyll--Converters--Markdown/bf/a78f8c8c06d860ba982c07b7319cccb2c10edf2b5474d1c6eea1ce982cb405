title: Donâ€™t blindly follow blog posts

<p>Technlogy changes fast!</p>

<p>And itâ€™s a blatant fact.</p>

<p>And with changing technology opinions, benchmarks and blog posts become obsolete, fast.</p>

<p>I was reading a blog post recently about adding some <a href="http://marianposaceanu.com/articles/improve-rails-performance-by-adding-a-few-gems">performance related gems</a>
to improve railsâ€™s performace. Itâ€™s a very nice, detailed article with benchmarks.</p>

<p>Instead of just blindly adding the suggested gems to the project, I ran the scripts again and found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">escape_utils</code> gem makes things worse on <code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby 2.3.1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">rails 5</code>, so no point in adding it.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">fast_blank</code> gem, on the other hand, makes things slightly better, so definitely worth adding. With
slightly better I mean you are able to make more requests/sec.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">je</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">jemalloc</code> gem didnâ€™t install for <code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby 2.3.1</code> at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, the point of this short blog post was to make you aware that blog posts go out of date and sometimes
itâ€™s necessary to re-evaluate the findings and ensure you are adding the gems for the right reasons.</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>

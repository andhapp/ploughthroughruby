I"î<p>Novelty of writing a gem has worn off. Back in the days when Rails had
just come out, writing a gem (or a plugin) was an achievement in itself.</p>

<p>What has a gem got to do with Rails? You write ruby gems and rails is
just another gem, no?</p>

<p>Correct!</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with Rails but my Ruby adventure began with Rails
and I for one give the credit where itâ€™s due, without a shadow of doubt.</p>

<h4 id="history">History</h4>

<p>Anyways, around 4 years ago, I created a gem called <a href="https://github.com/andhapp/is_bot">is_bot</a>. It offers some spam protection for web forms. I canâ€™t even remember the project I used it on back then.
However, recently weâ€™ve been marketing <a href="https://www.suggestion.io/">Suggestion.io</a> and encountered a lot of spam sign ups and decided to fix the issue.</p>

<h4 id="why-not-just-use-a-captcha">Why not just use a captcha?</h4>

<p>I hate asking prospective clients to fill in yet another field. You want
to make it easier not difficult to sign up. is_bot is different. It just
adds a invisible text field making it hidden from the actual users. Time
to get one back on the damn bots!</p>

<h4 id="why-reboot-why-not-use-a-rails-4-gem">Why reboot? Why not use a Rails 4 gem?</h4>

<p>I looked at few existing gems but none worked nicely. It was time to
reboot is_bot. Back then it was written for Rails 3 so had to upgrade it
for Rails 4 APIs which was a bit of a pain since itâ€™s hard to find what
changed from Rails 3 to Rails 4, easily. Reading through Rails source
code and looking at some of the other gems got us through.</p>

<p>I also took this opportunity to change a few more thingsâ€¦I say a few,
but so much has changed, hasnâ€™t it?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Replaced Jeweler with Bundler as a gem to manage my ruby gem. Just
find it easier to use.</li>
  <li>Started using semantic versioning. Makes perfect sense for open source project.</li>
  <li>Upgraded to latest RSpec.</li>
  <li>Replaced <code class="highlighter-rouge">.rvmrc</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ruby-gemset</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ruby-version</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was a bit of a work, but in the end all the efforts paid off.</p>

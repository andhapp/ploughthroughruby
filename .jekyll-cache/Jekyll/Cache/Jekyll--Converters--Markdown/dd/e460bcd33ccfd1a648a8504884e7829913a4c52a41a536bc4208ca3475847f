I"À<p>This is something very trivial and I kind of observed it whilst programming couple of weeks ago. For example, you had a method like this:</p>

<pre>
  class SomeClass
    def some_method(some_argument = '')
      raise ArgumentError unless some_argument
    end
  end
</pre>

<p>Now, I was under the impression that if I passed in a nil into this method, for some reason some_argument will still have the default value(â€˜â€™) as opposed to the nil value passed in but default arguments come into play when no value is passed in for the method arguments. But I was passing in nil which is an instance of NilClass and therefore some_argument gets assigned the nil value and an exception is raised.</p>

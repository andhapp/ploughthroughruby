I"¶<p>Do you know what $! means in Ruby?</p>

<p>Years ago, I was discussing some issue regarding GemCutter (now that makes
it ancient in programming age), and we were talking about global
variables in Ruby, for example, $; and $/. At the time, we couldnâ€™t
really find a place to look them up, even Google <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%24!+Ruby&amp;oq=%24!+Ruby&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2487j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">isnâ€™t very effective</a> given 
the nature of the query.</p>

<p>Anyways, while looking through Rubyâ€™s standard library, I found the file
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.0/libdoc/English/rdoc/English.html">English.rb</a>. 
This library has English names for all the cryptic global variables. For
example: $ERROR_INFO represents $!.</p>

<p>If you ever have to look up the English names, which I suggest you do as
it makes code easier to read, just refer to that file.</p>

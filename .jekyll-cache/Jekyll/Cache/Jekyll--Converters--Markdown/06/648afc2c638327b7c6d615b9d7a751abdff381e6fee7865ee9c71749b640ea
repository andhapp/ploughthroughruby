I"¨<p>Found a very nice article on metod arguments in Ruby. Please visit the <a href="http://www.skorks.com/2009/08/method-arguments-in-ruby/">link</a> to read it. Good article Alan!</p>

<p>I will be posting an extension to this article highlighting some of the changes in Ruby 1.9 that I know of.</p>

<p>Update: Apologies Alan did actually use Ruby 1.9. I guess that means I do not have anything else to add to it then.</p>

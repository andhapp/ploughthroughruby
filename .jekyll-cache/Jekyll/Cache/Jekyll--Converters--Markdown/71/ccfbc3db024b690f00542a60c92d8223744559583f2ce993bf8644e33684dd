I"F<p>We have been adding Rspec + Capybara to <a href="https://suggestion.io">Suggestion.io</a> 
to ensure we don’t create any regression bugs. There are plenty of resources 
online to set-up Capybara to use Selenium’s Chrome driver (instead of Firefox).</p>

<h3 id="but-what-if-you-are-using-chrome-canary-as-your-browser">But, what if you are using Chrome Canary as your browser?</h3>

<p>You would probably see the following error:</p>

<pre>
Selenium::WebDriver::Error::UnknownError: unknown error: cannot find Chrome binary
</pre>

<p>There are two ways to fix this issue:</p>

<p>### Solution 1 - Download Chrome</p>

<p>Whilst, searching for the solution, I ended up on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver">ChromeDriver’s wiki</a>. 
It clearly states that Chrome driver expects the Chrome binary to be in:</p>

<pre>
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome
</pre>

<p>That’s exactly where Chrome is installed on a Mac, so, to fix this issue
just download Chrome.</p>

<h3 id="solution-2---pass-the-location-of-chrome-canarys-binary-to-selenium-chrome-driver-via-capybara">Solution 2 - Pass the location of Chrome Canary’s binary to Selenium Chrome Driver via Capybara</h3>

<p>Downloading Chrome just for the sake of passing specs doesn’t make
sense. Googling revealed that there’s something called ‘ChromeOptions’, but, 
how the hell do I pass that option from Capybara, so that it get’s passed 
correctly to Selenium Chrome driver. After, trawling through the
capybara and selenium-webdriver source, I found a way to pass the location 
of Chrome Canary as the binary. Here’s how:</p>

<pre>
Capybara.register_driver :chrome do |app|
  Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, 
    browser: :chrome, 
    desired_capabilities: {
      "chromeOptions" =&gt; {
        "binary" =&gt; '/Applications/Google Chrome Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome Canary' 
      } 
    })
end
</pre>

<p>The ‘binary’ option specifies the location of Chrome Canary’s binary on
your Mac.</p>

<p>That was a couple of hours well spent. Hope it helps!</p>

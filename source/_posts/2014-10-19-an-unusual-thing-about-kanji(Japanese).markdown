title: An unsual thing about kanji(Japanese)

Recently, I was reading an article on natural language processing of
Japanese characters and came across something very unusual about the way
Japanese characters are written, there is no delimiters between the
words, for example, if 'Ruby' and 'Blog' are two kanji characters then
they will be written as 'RubyBlog' with no delimiter (space in English)
between them. It makes segmenting Japanese text a lot harder since
combination of characters could mean two entirely different things. 

I just found it very fascinating and challenging at the same time.

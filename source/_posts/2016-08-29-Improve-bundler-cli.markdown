Learn another programming language.

Learn from another programming ecosystem.

Learn from another programming language's tools and bring it back to the language you love.

Fact is, I love Ruby!

However, I've been spending a lot of time with Node.js lately. NPM provides a nice way to install
any new packages straight from the command line, like:

```
npm install react --save
```

I like this convenience.

With an intention to improve Ruby's ecosystem and tools, I would like to bring this to Ruby.

So, I've added a [new issue](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4932) to Bundler. Let's see what others feel about it.

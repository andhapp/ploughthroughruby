  <p>Reading open source code is almost always a good idea. Open source code
has the benefit of being reviewed by a lot of committed users and it
just shows the good patterns of programming. For instance, I once
looked at Arel, and the code demonstrates an exemplary use of visitor
pattern. There isn’t much code there, yet it manages to achieve so much.</p>

<p>Recently, I was reading some open source code recently and spotted $DEBUG
environment variable in quite a few places. At the time, I thought it
must be something the author used to simplify debugging. But, no, it’s
defined and used by ruby core. Ruby provides a debug flag (-d or –debug) 
which when used would set the $DEBUG to true.</p>

<p>Try running the following script in irb, pry or whatever else you use:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ruby -d -e 'if $DEBUG; puts "Debugging"; end'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and you should see something like this as output:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>RUBY_GC_HEAP_FREE_SLOTS=200000 (default value: 4096)
RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT=90000000 (default value: 16777216)
Exception `LoadError' at /Users/andhapp/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.0/lib/ruby/2.2.0/rubygems.rb:1222 - cannot load such file -- rubygems/defaults/operating_system
Exception `LoadError' at /Users/andhapp/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.0/lib/ruby/2.2.0/rubygems.rb:1231 - cannot load such file -- rubygems/defaults/ruby
Debugging
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Don’t worry about the two exceptions as in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1851232/20301">debug mode exceptions are displayed</a> even when they are rescued.</p>

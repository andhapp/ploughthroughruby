  <p>I got hold of an out-of-date <a href="http://hawthorne-press.com/WebPage_RHG.html">Ruby Hacking Guide</a> and it looks very interesting. Therefore, in order to improve my understanding of Ruby internals, I have decided to spend time in reading it and the writing posts about it. The entire book can be downloaded in the form of HTML pages and might not make sense since some of it has been machine translated.</p>

<p>I hope my efforts are useful for anyone willing to venture into Ruby Internals.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got hold of an out-of-date <a href="http://hawthorne-press.com/WebPage_RHG.html">Ruby Hacking Guide</a> and it looks very interesting. Therefore, in order to improve my understanding of Ruby internals, I have decided to spend time in reading it and the writing posts about it. The entire book can be downloaded in the form of HTML pages and might not make sense since some of it has been machine translated.</p>

<p>I hope my efforts are useful for anyone willing to venture into Ruby Internals.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is something very trivial and I kind of observed it whilst programming couple of weeks ago. For example, you had a method like this:</p>

<pre>
  class SomeClass
    def some_method(some_argument = '')
      raise ArgumentError unless some_argument
    end
  end
</pre>


<p>Now, I was under the impression that if I passed in a nil into this method, for some reason some_argument will still have the default value(&#8221;) as opposed to the nil value passed in but default arguments come into play when no value is passed in for the method arguments. But I was passing in nil which is an instance of NilClass and therefore some_argument gets assigned the nil value and an exception is raised.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is always easy to find solutions on Google but the real fun is in finding out how a bit of code works. It just helps you understand much more about the language and how it behaves. Converting an array to hash is easy. Just use this piece of code that I found on google:</p>

<pre>
  some_array = [1,2,3]
  some_hash = Hash[*(some_array.collect{|v| [v,v]}.flatten)] # yields {1=>1, 2=>2, 3=>3}
</pre>


<p>Few people have asked the question behind this conversion and I just decided to break it apart and tackle it bit by bit. Our objective, again, is to convert an array to a hash. Hash&#8217;s ruby documenation tells us that a new Hash object can be created by using even number of arguments. Something similar to the following code:</p>

<pre>
  some_hash = Hash[1,1,2,2,3,3] # This creates a hash object similar to this {1=>1, 2=>2, 3=>3}
</pre>


<p>All we need to do now is convert our some_array (defined in the first code snippet) and convert it into [1,1,2,2,3,3].</p>

<p>It&#8217;s simple really. We take the some_array and convert it into an array&#8217;s or array like this:</p>

<pre>
  some_array = [1,2,3]
  some_array.collect{|v| [v, v]} # will yield [[1,1], [2,2], [3,3]]
</pre>


<p>Now to convert it into [1,1,2,2,3,3] we just need to flatten this array of arrays like this:</p>

<pre>
  some_array = [1,2,3]
  some_array.collect{|v| [v, v]}.flatten # will yield [1,1,2,2,3,3]
</pre>


<p>Now, all we need to do is use the splat (*) unary operator. The splat operator expands the supplied array into individual arguments which is what we need to convert array into a hash. You could also achieve the same with the following snippet:</p>

<pre>
  some_array = [1,2,3]
  some_hash = Hash[*(some_array+some_array).sort] # yields {1=>1, 2=>2, 3=>3}
</pre>


<p>I hope you can work that out yourself. I hope this little discussion helped you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Reading Open Source Code is probably the best way of learning new ways. Paperclip is an amazing file upload tool by brilliant guys at Thoughtbot. And yesterday, while going through their code I realised that <strong>rescue</strong> can be used as a statement modifier. For example, consider this block of code below:</p>

<pre>
  type = (self.path.match(/\.(\w+)$/)[1] rescue "octet-stream").downcase
</pre>


<p>What do you think happens here?
Its quite simple really. If the first statement (the match bit) raises and exception the second statement is executed instead.</p>

<p>Another way to write this would be:</p>

<pre>
  begin
    type = (self.path.match(/\.(\w+)$/)[1]).downcase
  rescue
    "octet-stream"
  end

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know you must be thinking proc and Proc is the same thing and I must have mistyped. But, proc and Proc are different things. Blocks is a beautiful concept and you can achieve so much by using blocks carefully that it is unbelievable. I created a simple DSL using blocks and Faker gem to spit out XML used for testing purposes. I mean it took me few hours to do the first version up and running in Sinatra. Amazing.</p>

<p>So, block is nothing more than bits of code within curly brackets. The concept of blocks is used excessively throughout Ruby in iterators like inject, select, map, each and so on and so forth. For example:</p>

<pre>
def example_from_a_block
  puts "Should call a block"
  yield 
  puts "Yes, I did!"
end
</pre>


<p>and invoke it like:</p>

<pre>
example_from_a_block { puts "in a block" }
</pre>


<p>But blocks do have problems. Not exactly problems, but yeah shortcoming for sure. They are not objects. So&#8230;what difference does it make if they are not objects. I don&#8217;t care man. I like them. Exactly you like blocks but you would love blocks wrapped as objects. Yes, these things do exist. They are called proc or lambda. So what is a proc then? It is basically a block but with object like features, I mean you can manipulate them and pass them around like regular objects. Cool.</p>

<p>To create a proc, just do:</p>

<pre>
p = Proc.new { puts "I am a proc" }
</pre>


<p></p>

<p>It is absolutely essential to pass a block to a proc. &#8220;p&#8221; is basically an instance of the class <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Proc.html">Proc</a>. Run this in you irb session and confim that it is indeed an object with an object_id:</p>

<pre>
p.object_id
</pre>


<p>Hmm&#8230;two down one to go. What exactly is a proc then. proc is just a simple global method, if you will, of the Kernel module. So, you can just invoke it like this:</p>

<pre>
kernels_proc_variable = proc {|a| a + 10 }
</pre>


<p>Now, proc behaves differently in Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9. In 1.8, it returns a lambda where as in 1.9 it is a synonym for Proc.new. So, please be aware of this simple yet pivotal difference. Pivotal because lambda&#8217;s and proc&#8217;s are slightly different, although on the surface they look the same. They are both instances of Proc so let us just say they are siblings. There is so much more you can do with Procs and this post has just touched the surface of it. I will discuss lambda and closures in the coming posts and then compare them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is obvious from the subject that I am going to talk about the streams $stdin, $stdout and $stderr but it would be a fun ride with lots of examples and good explanations. However, there is another set of global variables called STDOUT, STDIN, STDERR. In addition to STDIN, there is ARGF and DATA for reading data in so you know you can research into these things.</p>

<p>Any variable in ruby that starts with a $ sign is a global variable. You do not need to define it. It is given to you. Great!. Now, every ruby process on a UNIX (POSIX) system gives you three file descriptors stdin(fd0), stdout(fd1) and stderr(fd2). To generalise, every process is presumed to have three file descriptors, namely, standard output, standard input and standard error to communicate to the underlying OS. Since, ruby runs as a process it would also get these three file descriptors. So, $stderr, $stdout and $stdin are basically wrappers to those file descriptors and assist us in talking to the OS. Trivial operations like print this out on the console actually employs $stdout for outputting.</p>

<p>What kind of objects are they? Let us go to good old irb and run some code. Run the code below:</p>

<pre>
$stdout.kind_of?(IO)
</pre>


<p>This would give you &#8220;true&#8221; which bascially means that $stdout is an IO object. <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/IO.html#M002278">IO</a> is the main input output library in ruby. Do check out the rdoc for other exciting things you can do with it. Ok. Good that we have these file descriptors so what. I do not need to know how &#8220;puts&#8221; outputs stuff to the console. I just use it. Well, that is good but one should definitely have a good understanding of controlling where the output goes otherwise when someone asks you - <strong>&#8220;How do I redirect my output to a file instead of console?&#8221;</strong>, you would just sit there with no answer. So, let us try and find an answer to the same question so that you do not look like a fool.</p>

<p>As it happens, we can actually redefine the $stdout. The following code would do exactly that when run in irb:</p>

<pre>
$stdout = File.open("test.log", "w")
</pre>


<p>It basically tells $stdout to spit everything out to a file called &#8220;test.log&#8221;. That&#8217;s it. Its done. Now, when you send a mesage to puts method it would use the newly defined $stdout and do the needful. Run this code in the same irb session as above and and see what happens:</p>

<pre>
puts "I am going to the file. It is more fun than printing on the cosole."
</pre>


<p>and you would not see this printed out in the console. Go and check the file test.log but to your surprise it would not be there. So, where the heck is it? Well, what happens is it is stored in a buffer and not written to the file until the buffer gets full (I am not entirely sure about this but I am guessing that would be the case). Now, if you terminate your irb session and check test.log you would find the entire ouput there but I do not want to end the session. I want to do the work and at the same time check the output. Well, not to worry the flush method does exactly that. Run this after every puts or print:</p>

<pre>
$stdout.flush
</pre>


<p>Voila! This clears the buffer and writes everthing to the file. So, there you are now you know how to redirect the output to a file. But hang on what if I want to go back to the console in the same session. Is that possible? Ofcourse, that is possible. Remember I told you about STDOUT at the beginning well that comes to the rescue. STDOUT and $stdout point to the same IO object. You can check that by running the following code in irb:</p>

<pre>
$stdout.equal?(STDOUT) 
</pre>


<p>and this gives you true, which proves my point. So, in order to go back to the original state you can just do this in order to redefine $stdout:</p>

<pre>
$stdout = STDOUT
</pre>


<p></p>

<p>Simple! Now, when you do:</p>

<pre>
puts "Oh Em Gee, I am back on the console."
</pre>


<p></p>

<p>You will see it straight away on your console. BTW, instead of $stdout you can redefine STDOUT and redirect the output to a file but puts or print would not be bothered about it as they use $stdout which is still pointing to the console.</p>

<p>Now comes the most interesting bit of the whole post. Are system calles affected by the redefining of $stdout. You know system calls. Well, in ruby you can use a system method to call the underlying OS functions, for example:</p>

<pre>
system('ls -l')
system('echo Wheeee')
</pre>


<p>So, the question is what happens when you redefine the $stdout does that affect the output of these system calls. And the answer is Nope, it does not. The child processes like system would still use the existing output channel that the ruby process had in the beginning. Redefining, $stdout would not change the file descriptor. The file descriptors are still there and when we redefine $stdout we just stop using them. But the native calls to the OS will still use the console for output.</p>

<p>That was a long post! I hope now you are better equipped with the IO knowledge and how it all works in ruby.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a <a href="http://www.ploughthroughruby.co.uk/2009/08/is-variable-an-object/">previous post</a>, I have explained that variables are basically passed by values in ruby but since they have a reference to the original object any mutator methods can bascially modify the object itself. However, there are two exceptions to this; Fixnum and Symbol.</p>

<p>Both, Fixnum and Symbol, store the values and have no reference to the object. This also applies that there are no mutator methods for Fixnum and Symbol and they are immutable. So, how can we actually prove this fact. Let us do a simple experiment and I think I might have done this before but I do not want you going back and forth between posts so let us just do it again. Run the code snippet and we are going through each step:</p>

<pre>
  fixnum_1 = 3
  p fixnum_1.object_id
  fixnum_2 = 3
  p fixnum_2.object_id
  str_1 = "3"
  p str_1.object_id
  str_2 = "3"
  p str_2.object_id
</pre>


<p>You will see that both the fixnum variables have the same object_id where as with str variables they will be different. So, what does that mean? It simply means that two fixnums of same value always represent the same object instance, so instance variables for Fixnum with value 1 are shared across the system. The same is the case with Symbol.</p>

<p>Ok. Fine. This makes perfect sense but why should I bother with all this explanation. Well, that is a million dollar question really and the answer to that is &#8220;You can&#8217;t define singleton methods on Fixnums and Symbols&#8221;. What? Why? I know this is confusing but when in doubt think of an example.</p>

<p>We previously established that all the fixnum variables with same value are actually pointing to the same object instance. If let us say I want to define a singleton method on one then it would really define the singleton method on that object instance which means all the fixnum variables with same value would really share that new method you have added. Therefore, in order to cut that possibilty out one cannot define singleton methods on Fixnum, and Symbls.</p>

<p>Update: I have just realised that true (TrueClass), false (FalseClass) and nil (NilClass) also store the references as immediate values. And, yes there is a TrueClass, FalseClass and NilClass and true, false and nil are singleton instances of these classes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ruby is an object oriented programming. Let us look at a code sinpet:</p>

<pre>
 str =  String.new("ruby rocks")
</pre>


<p>So, we define a variable called &#8220;str&#8221;, which stores a pointer to the object created by sending &#8220;new&#8221; on &#8220;String&#8221;. Here, &#8220;String&#8221; receives the &#8220;new&#8221; message but for &#8220;String&#8221; to take any action when it receives &#8220;new&#8221; message it must have a reference to the object called String. Therefore, there must be a corresponding constant to every class in ruby. It can&#8217;t be a variable as it starts with an uppercase.</p>

<p>Actually, that is exactly what happens. Every class in ruby has a global constant which stores a reference to the object and is used for method invocations. So, there are two things really one is the constant named String and the other is the object named String.</p>
